            <h3>8. Consider Long-term Costs</h3>
            <p>Factor in potential increases in rent, maintenance costs, and utility bills over time.</p>
            
            <h3>9. Meet the Neighbors</h3>

  <h1 class="mb-4">PG vs Apartment: Making the Right Choice</h1>
  <p class="lead">Are you moving to a new city and stuck between choosing a PG (Paying Guest) accommodation or renting an apartment? It’s a common dilemma, especially for students, working professionals, and first-time renters. Both options come with their own set of pros and cons, and the best choice ultimately depends on your lifestyle, budget, and personal preferences.</p>

  <p>Let’s break it down so you can make the right decision with confidence.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-5"><i class="bi bi-house-door-fill me-2"></i>What Is a PG?</h3>
  <p>A <strong>Paying Guest (PG)</strong> setup is typically a room (shared or private) in a house managed by a landlord. Meals, utilities, and housekeeping are usually included. PGs are popular among students and freshers who want a budget-friendly, semi-furnished place without the hassle of managing daily chores.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-4"><i class="bi bi-building me-2"></i>What About Apartments?</h3>
  <p>An <strong>apartment</strong> is a self-contained housing unit that gives you complete privacy and independence. You rent the space (either alone or with roommates) and are responsible for managing your own food, cleaning, and utility bills. It’s ideal for those who want flexibility and long-term stability.</p>

  <h3 class="mt-5"><i class="bi bi-search me-2"></i>PG vs Apartment – Key Differences</h3>

  <div class="mt-4">
    <h5><i class="bi bi-currency-rupee me-2"></i>1. Cost</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PG:</strong> Budget-friendly with meals and utilities often included.</li>
      <li><strong>Apartment:</strong> Higher rent and separate expenses like electricity, internet, and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><i class="bi bi-shield-lock me-2"></i>2. Privacy</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PG:</strong> Shared living = less privacy.</li>
      <li><strong>Apartment:</strong> Your own space = full privacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><i class="bi bi-card-checklist me-2"></i>3. Rules & Freedom</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PG:</strong> Curfews, no guests, and house rules may apply.</li>
      <li><strong>Apartment:</strong> Total freedom—you’re the boss of your own space.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5><i class="bi bi-egg-fried me-2"></i>4. Food & Facilities</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PG:</strong> Meals are usually provided, saving time.</li>
      <li><strong>Apartment:</strong> You cook your own food or order out—more flexibility, but more effort.</li>
    </ul>
